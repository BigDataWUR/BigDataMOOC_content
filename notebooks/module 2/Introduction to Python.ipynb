    "#### <u>Variables</u>\n",
    "Variables are small pieces of memory that can store a value. They have a **name**, which makes it easy to retrieve the **value**. You could imagine that in Pythons memory is a large chest with drawers in them: each drawer is a variable. Each drawer has a label (the name), and inside the drawer is some content (the value). Whenever a variable value is needed, we can call its name, and then the value is retrieved. Or, in the analogy, when the name of the variable is mentioned, we pull open the drawer with that label, and we find the content inside, which we need to work with. Anything can be used as a variable name, as long as it is one word (no spaces!) and starts with a letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define always define a new variable by stating the name we want to give this variable and **assigning** a value to it, using the = sign. If we assign a new value to the same variable again, then the new value will overwrite the previous value. Python always works from top to bottom: the latest value is the value it will work with. We assign values to variables in the following way (see examples in the cell below, you can also define a few variables of your own in the cell). We can use the print statement to see the variable value on screen. Also try and assign a new value to the same variable, and see what happens."

The example below, with the temperature, will make this clear, hopefully. You can see that multiple conditions can be added, as if you are working through a decision tree.

Also, you can determine the range of values that this variable should have. During the execution of the `for` loop, the variable takes on the values from the range, one after the other. First, the variable takes the first value of the range, and the indented code (the indented loop body) is executed for the first time. When execution has finished, the variable takes on the next value of the range, and the same code is executed again (but now with a different value for the variable). After each execution of the body, the variable takes on the next value, and repeats the code, until the final value in the range has been reached. Then the loop stops, and the code following the loop (if any) is executed next. "

    "We can package several statements into reusable packages called **functions**. A function is defined first, and can be called afterwards. There are lots of standard functions in Python already, such as *print*. A function has zero or more **parameters**, provided between parentheses after its name. The print function takes one argument, which then gets printed on screen. Usually (but not necessarily), functions provide a return value: the function result.\n",

    "An example of a function in mathematics is the function **square**. It has one parameter: the number that needs to be squared. When we call function **square**, we have to provide an argument for it. For example, we can call it with argument the value 3. The function takes that argument, does its job (namely: square it), and returns the function result: the value 9.\n",

A function is called by its name and by providing the required arguments (check the call to function print in previous examples).

    "In the example below, the function is **called** from within the print statement, which is in itself a function. So the **print** function needs to print something. What will it print? Well, it will print whatever the call to function **addition** gives back as return value. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can't call function **addition** just like that: it needs arguments. The function definition states that it requires two arguments: **number_1** and **number_2**, in that order. In the call, we need to provide two concrete arguments that have actual numbers as values, so that the function can make an actual calculation. In this example, we use the two variables **x** and **y** as arguments of the call, which were already defined before the function definition. When the function is called, it relates variable **x** to its parameter **number_1**, and variable **y** to its parameter **number_2**. The function body is then carried out with the actual values that were provided through **x** and **y**. Finally, the function returns the return value (variable **result**), which is then printed.

Those methods are already available for datastructures, so you don't need to define them yourself anymore. A method works just like a function, but it has a different notation: using a full stop. For example, if we had a list called `my_list` and we wanted to sort it, we would say: `my_list.sort()`. If we had defined a function `sort` for it, we would need `my_list` as argument, `sort(my_list)`. But now that `sort` is a method, it's clear that it's called for the datastructure before the full stop: `my_list`, and no argument is given. Of course if any other arguments are needed, they should still be provided. For example, the method `count` needs to know which element should be counted, so that should be provided as an argument.
